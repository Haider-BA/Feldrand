== FELDRAND ==

= Abstract =

  FELDRAND is a realtime fluid simulator. It works on 2-dimensional domains
  which contain arbitrarily shaped objects (e.g. wings). It aims to be as
  simple and user-friendly as a MRT-Lattice-Boltzman simulation can be.

= Structure =

  The heart of the FELDRAND is a library that allows to create simulations
  with the desired setup and parameters. Once a simulation is created it will
  asynchronously run a Lattice-Boltzmann simulation on the domain and give
  access to the resulting velocity and density fields for viualisation or
  storage.

  A second library is responsible for the realtime visualisation of the
  simulation data.

  Finally those two libraries are used in the FELDRAND GUI which provides
  a hopefully easy to use interface to the world of fluids.

= Installation =

  FELDRAND is built via cmake (http://www.cmake.org). To install simply type
  "cmake DIR" where DIR is where this README resides. You should be awarded
  with a Makefile. Type "make" to compile and "./bin/feldrand_gui" to run.
  Important: The code does heavily rely on C++11 features, so you need a
  reasonably up to date C++ compiler like gcc 4.8

  Used packages:
  qt4
  cmake

= History =

  The first version of FELDRAND was written as a project of the Ferienakademie
  2012 (www.ferienakademie.de). Even under the rough conditions there (many
  bottles of wine and daily hiking) did the team manage to produce a visually
  impressive software that was able to simulate the flow around wings of
  arbitrary geometry in realtime with the ability to capture the wing-shapes
  via a webcam. The resulting wing-drawing competition (again bottles of
  wine...) showed the potential of such a software for experimenting with
  aerodynamics.  That is why the Chair of System Simulation at the
  FAU-Erlangen-Nürnberg decided to develop a new version of the FELDRAND, this
  time with sane design and fewer bugs.
