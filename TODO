== TODO list for the FELDRAND ==

* primary goals
 - [ ] Finish the save load system
 - [ ] No crashes due to some geomety/speed
 - [ ] Finish New... mechanism
 - [ ] Add Lift/Drag widget
* secondary goals
 - [ ] add OpenCV image recognition
 - [ ] sanify simulation internal threading
 - [ ] use OpenCL for the LBM simulation
 - [ ] show FPS and steps per second
 - [ ] sanify coordinates
   (no ugly borders, only (0,1)x(0,1) coordinates in visualisation)
 - [ ] let Simulation return SI unit grids
 - [ ] use OpenMP for parallelisation (but should still work without...)
 - [ ] use shader programs for visualisation
   Unfortunately this creates problems with compatibility on some drivers
 - [ ] build FELDRAND for Mac
 - [ ] build FELDRAND for Windows
 - [ ] measure the physical accuracy of the simulation on some scale
   to achieve guaranteed realtime, drastical (and incorrect) optimisations
   are sometimes necessary. This makes it transparent how many
   of these optimisations are active. More a fun feature nontheless.
